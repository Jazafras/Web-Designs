						<h3>I</h3>
						Among twenty snowy mountains,<br/>
						The only moving thing<br/> 
						Was the eye of the blackbird.
					</section>
	
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird2.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>II</h3>
						I was of three minds,<br/>
						Like a tree<br/>   
						In which there are three blackbirds.
					</section>   
					
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird5.png" height=80px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>III</h3>
						The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br/>   
						It was a small part of the pantomime.
					</section>
					
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird4.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>IV</h3>
						A man and a woman<br/>
						Are one.<br/>
						A man and a woman and a blackbird<br/>   
						Are one.
					</section>
					
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird3.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>V</h3>
						I do not know which to prefer,<br/>   
						The beauty of inflections<br/>  
						Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br/>   
						The blackbird whistling<br/>  
						Or just after.
					</section>
					
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird1.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>VI</h3>
						Icicles filled the long window<br/>   
						With barbaric glass.<br/>   
						The shadow of the blackbird<br/>   
						Crossed it, to and fro.<br/>   
						The mood<br/>
						Traced in the shadow<br/>   
						An indecipherable cause.
					</section>  
					
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird6.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>VII</h3>
						O thin men of Haddam,<br/>
						Why do you imagine golden birds?<br/>   
						Do you not see how the blackbird<br/> 
						Walks around the feet<br/>   
						Of the women about you?
					</section>   
	
					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird7.png" height=60px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>VIII</h3>
						I know noble accents<br/>   
						And lucid, inescapable rhythms;<br/>   
						But I know, too,<br/>   
						That the blackbird is involved<br/>   
						In what I know.
					</section>   

					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird8.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>IX</h3>
						When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br/>   
						It marked the edge<br/>   
						Of one of many circles.
					</section>   

					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird9.png" height=70px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>X</h3>
						At the sight of blackbirds<br/>   
						Flying in a green light,<br/>   
						Even the bawds of euphony<br/>   
						Would cry out sharply.
					</section>   

					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird10.png" height=60px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>XI</h3>
						He rode over Connecticut<br/>   
						In a glass coach.<br/>   
						Once, a fear pierced him,<br/>   
						In that he mistook<br/>   
						The shadow of his equipage<br/>   
						For blackbirds.
					</section>   

					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird11.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>XII</h3>
						The river is moving.<br/>   
						The blackbird must be flying.
					</section>   

					<section class="stanza">
					<img src="images/bird12.png" height=50px alt="bird"/><br/>
						<h3>XIII</h3>
						It was evening all afternoon.<br/>   
						It was snowing<br/>   
						And it was going to snow.<br/>   
						The blackbird sat<br/>   
						In the cedar-limbs.
